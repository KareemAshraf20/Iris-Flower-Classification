## 📌 Project 1: Iris Flower Classification  

### 📖 Project Overview  
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements using various machine learning models. The dataset is the famous Iris dataset from scikit-learn.  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

### 📊 Dataset  
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features:  
- Sepal length  
- Sepal width  
- Petal length  
- Petal width  

Target variable: Species (0 = Setosa, 1 = Versicolor, 2 = Virginica)  

### 🧠 Models Implemented  
1. **Logistic Regression**  
2. **Random Forest Classifier**  
3. **Bagging Classifier** (with Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression as base estimators)  
4. **Custom Bagging Implementation** (from scratch)  
5. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**  
6. **AdaBoost Classifier** (with Decision Tree and SVC as base estimators)  

### 📈 Results  
All models achieved **100% accuracy** on the test set, demonstrating the simplicity and separability of the Iris dataset.
